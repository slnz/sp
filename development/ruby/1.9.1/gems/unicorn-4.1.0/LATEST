=== unicorn 4.1.0 - small updates and fixes / 2011-08-20 00:33 UTC

  * Rack::Chunked and Rack::ContentLength middlewares are loaded
    by default for RACK_ENV=(development|deployment) users to match
    Rack::Server behavior.  As before, use RACK_ENV=none if you want
    fine-grained control of your middleware.  This should also
    help users of Rainbows! and Zbatery.

  * CTL characters are now rejected from HTTP header values

  * Exception messages are now filtered for [:cntrl:] characters
    since application/middleware authors may forget to do so

  * Workers will now terminate properly if a SIGQUIT/SIGTERM/SIGINT
    is received while during worker process initialization.

  * close-on-exec is explicitly disabled to future-proof against
    Ruby 2.0 changes [ruby-core:38140]
