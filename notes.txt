* Under (?) on customizable questions: You can add up to five customizable questions to the application that are specific only for your summer project. All of these questions will be displayed as “required.” A few thoughts: Clarify if the question is for acceptance (required by all), or is just for further information – for example: “Optional: Do you have lifeguard certification?” Please remember that questions need to not be biased or discriminatory. If you have any questions, ask your regional or ministry summer project coordinator or email gosummerproject.com.
