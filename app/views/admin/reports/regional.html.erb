        I still find the definitions for US/WSN/Other Ministries ambiguous.  I'm sure you can write it quickly, I did most of the hard work already, it just needs the query adjusted.

        I can't figure out how to determine which area a project is in.  All I see in project is target area which doesn't look right.

        I'm not sure how to get "All other Partners that report stats to "Other CCC Ministries" in Operations Tab under Edit Project Info.
        I did go in to the code there and found some string descriptions of where they report to.  But I don't know how to translate them to partners.
